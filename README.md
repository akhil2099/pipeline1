Project Summary: Automating Infrastructure Provisioning and Continuous Integration with AWS, Terraform, and Jenkins


"This endeavor effectively established a DevOps pipeline to support a web application, harnessing the capabilities of AWS, Terraform, and Jenkins. Leveraging Terraform, we orchestrated the provisioning of essential AWS infrastructure elements such as EC2 instances and networking components. Concurrently, Jenkins was configured to orchestrate continuous integration processes, ensuring the seamless generation of the application from its source control repository. This refined workflow promotes efficiency across the development, testing, and deployment phases of the web application."
